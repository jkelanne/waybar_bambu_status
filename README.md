# TODO
- [ ] Add example configuration for waybar
- [ ] Figure out how to handle the environment variables
- [ ] Figure why the waybar plugin isn't working on multiple displays
- [ ] There are more useful information in the MQTT packet that we can use.
- [ ] The first message from the printer takes some time, so we probably should push somekind of "loading" message.
- [ ] We're sometimes getting the message: "connection lost before Subscribe completed" and "bambu_status stopped unexpectedly, is it endless?"
